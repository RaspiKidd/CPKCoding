# Creating an Inclusive Environment

## Welcome Procedures for Newcomers

- Create a dedicated "First Visit Guide" with visual instructions and club etiquette
- Assign "welcome ambassadors" from established participants to support newcomers
- Develop a simple orientation activity that results in immediate success. e.g. micro:bit name badge
- Establish a "return visitor reward" to encourage continued participation. e.g. Code Club stickers and 3D printed name badge on 3rd visit
- Create photo permission forms that respect varying comfort levels with documentation

## Mixed-age Interaction Guidelines

- Implement clear expectations for cross-age communication and collaboration
- Develop a structured mentoring program pairing older and younger participants
- Create specific collaborative challenges designed for mixed-age teams
- Establish "expertise badges" that highlight skills rather than age or experience. e.g. Different coloured name badges
- Provide conversation prompts that encourage intergenerational knowledge exchange

## Parent Involvement Opportunities

- Create a termly "Family Coding Evening" with take-home projects
- Establish a parent volunteer rota with specific, skill-appropriate roles
- Develop a "Parent's Guide to micro:bit" with home support suggestions
- Implement a communication system (newsletter, email) for updates
- Create showcase opportunities where participants can demonstrate skills to family

## Regular Showcases

- Organise termly showcase events open to the wider community
- Create a dedicated display area in the library for rotating project exhibitions
- Create opportunities for participants to demonstrate projects at community events
