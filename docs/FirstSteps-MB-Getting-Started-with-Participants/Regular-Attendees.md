# Regular Attendee Progress

## Progress Tracking Systems

- **Digital Badges**: Virtual achievements for completing project milestones (available through Code Club progress Paths)
- **Project Portfolios** (Optional): Physical or digital collections of completed work
  - Document folder with printed code and project descriptions
  - Optional screenshots or photographs of projects in action
  - Brief reflections on challenges and solutions
- **Skill Ladders** (Optional): Visual progression charts showing advancement through concept areas:
  - Input/Output mastery
  - Variables and data handling
  - Conditional logic
  - Loops and iteration
  - Functions and modularization
- **Achievement Wall**: Public display (with permission) highlighting participant accomplishments
  
## Advanced Project Pathways

- **Project Extension Cards**: Ideas for enhancing basic projects with additional features
- **Challenge Series**: Progressive tasks that build upon previously mastered skills
- **Interest Tracks**: Specialised project pathways based on participant preferences:
  - Game Development Track
  - Science and Data Track
  - Art and Animation Track
  - Music and Sound Track
- **Personal Project Support**: Guidance for participants developing their own project ideas

## Peer Teaching Opportunities

- **Buddy System**: Pairing experienced participants with newcomers
- **Mini-Workshops**: Opportunities for confident participants to demonstrate techniques to the group
- **Project Showcases**: Dedicated time for sharing completed projects and explaining the code
- **Documentation Contributors** (Optional): Involving regular attendees in creating guides for new projects
- **Junior Volunteers**: Formal role for dedicated participants to assist with session delivery

## Community Integration

- **Project Exhibition**: Regular displays of work in the main library space
- **Digital Showcase**: Library website or social media features highlighting participant projects
- **Inter-Library Challenges**: Collaborative projects with other library code clubs
- **Local Tech Events**: Opportunities to represent the library at community STEM events
- **School Connections**: Sharing projects with local schools to reinforce classroom learning

## Long-Term Engagement Strategies

- **Advisory Group**: Involving regular attendees in planning future session content
- **Advanced Equipment Access**: Priority access to additional components and sensors
- **Special Workshops**: Exclusive events for regular participants exploring advanced topics
- **Project Competitions**: Themed challenges with recognition for innovative solutions (jousting robots)
- **Progression Pathways**: Information about next steps beyond micro:bit (Python, Arduino, etc.

## Recognition and Celebration

- **Milestone Certificates**: Formal recognition of significant achievements
- **Term-End Showcases**: Events where participants can demonstrate projects to family and community
- **Digital Leader Badges** (optional): Physical badges denoting expertise in specific skills
- **Annual Awards**: Recognition for outstanding projects, consistent attendance, and peer support
- **Community Contribution**: Opportunities to apply coding skills to benefit local organisations

By creating distinct, thoughtful experiences for both first-time visitors and regular attendees, libraries can build sustainable code clubs that continuously engage participants while welcoming newcomers to the coding community.
