# Device Organisation

## Numbering System for Devices

- Implement a clear sequential numbering system for all micro:bit devices (e.g., MB-01, MB-02)
- Affix durable labels using permanent markers or printed stickers covered with clear tape
- Include the library name alongside the number to assist with recovery if devices are misplaced

## Sign-out Procedures

- Maintain a physical sign-out ledger with columns for device number, participant name, date, and return condition
- Alternatively, use a digital tracking system on a tablet or laptop dedicated to equipment management
- Require participants to initial or sign when collecting and returning devices
- For younger participants, involve a parent or guardian in the sign-out process
- Implement a 'device monitor' role for experienced participants to assist with the process

## Basic Maintenance Schedule

- Establish a weekly check of all devices for physical damage or battery issues
- Perform monthly firmware updates on all devices during quiet periods
- Maintain a maintenance log recording dates of checks, issues found, and actions taken
- Designate a specific staff member responsible for device maintenance oversight

## Storage Solutions

- Invest in compartmentalised storage boxes with foam inserts to protect devices
- Store USB cables separately in cable organisers to prevent tangling
- Use labelled containers for accessories (sensors, alligator clips, LEDs)

## Charging Routine

- Establish a post-session charging procedure for all devices
- Create a charging station with clearly labelled positions for each device
- Implement a rotation system to ensure even usage across all devices
- Maintain spare batteries for devices used with battery packs
