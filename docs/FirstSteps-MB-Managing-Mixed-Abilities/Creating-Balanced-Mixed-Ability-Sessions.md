# Creating Balanced Mixed-Ability Sessions

## Physical Space Organisation

- **Zone System**: Designated areas for different experience levels and project types
- **Resource Stations**: Self-service areas with levelled materials and reference guides
- **Collaboration Spaces**: Tables specifically for mixed-ability collaborative work
- **Showcase Area**: Space for displaying exemplary projects from all skill levels
- **Quiet Corner**: Low-stimulation space for focused work on complex problems

## Schedule Considerations

- **Parallel Activities**: Simultaneous projects at different difficulty levels
- **Common Starting Points**: Initial activities accessible to all with differentiated extensions
- **Flexible Timing**: Allowing different completion rates without pressure
- **Whole-Group Moments**: Strategic points where all participants engage together regardless of level
- **Progressive Challenges**: Activities that build on core skills while allowing advanced applications

## Collaborative Frameworks

- **Vertical Grouping**: Deliberately mixing experience levels within working groups
- **Role Distribution**: Assigning specific responsibilities based on individual strengths
- **Jigsaw Projects**: Complex activities where each participant contributes different components
- **Reciprocal Teaching**: Structures where participants alternate between teaching and learning roles
- **Project Consultations**: Formalised peer review processes for sharing expertise

## Community Building Across Levels

- **Shared Goals**: Collective challenges requiring contributions from all ability levels
- **Skill Exchange**: Formalised opportunities for participants to teach skills to one another
- **Recognition Systems**: Celebrating diverse achievements across experience spectrum
- **Mixed-Level Exhibitions**: Showcasing projects from all participants without hierarchy
