# Staff Facilitation Techniques

## Differentiation Methods

- **Tiered Activities**: Core projects with multiple levels of complexity
- **Extension Cards**: Add-on challenges for those who complete core activities quickly
- **Support Resources**: Scaffolding materials for those requiring additional guidance
- **Choice Boards**: Menus of options allowing participants to select appropriate challenges
- **Pace Variation**: Flexible timelines accommodating different working speeds

## Support Distribution

- **Targeted Assistance**: Strategic allocation of staff support based on identified needs
- **Peer Resource Activation**: Identifying and mobilising participant expertise
- **Just-in-Time Intervention**: Providing help at the point of need rather than preemptively
- **Group Problem-Solving**: Bringing together participants facing similar challenges
- **Self-Help Development**: Teaching strategies for independent problem resolution

By implementing these comprehensive approaches to managing mixed-ability groups, library code clubs can create inclusive environments where all participants—from complete beginners to advanced coders—can experience appropriate challenges, meaningful progress, and the satisfaction of being valued community members.
