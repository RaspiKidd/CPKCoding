# Additional Platform Options

## Scratch with micro:bit Extension

Scratch is a widely-used block-based programming environment that can connect to micro:bit through an extension, offering a bridge for participants familiar with Scratch.
  
### Implementation Considerations

- **Prior Knowledge Leverage**: Valuable for participants with existing Scratch experience
- **Connection Requirements**: Additional setup steps needed to connect Scratch with micro:bit
- **Limited Access**: Requires Scratch 3.0 desktop app or Chrome/Edge browsers
- **Hybrid Projects**: Enables creation of projects combining Scratch's visual capabilities with micro:bit's physical computing
- **Library Suitability**: Best implemented in libraries where Scratch clubs already exist

## EduBlocks

EduBlocks provides a middle-ground between block-based and text-based programming, using Python blocks to ease the transition to text coding.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Transition Tool**: Specifically designed to bridge the gap between blocks and text
- **Visual Python**: Block representation follows Python syntax patterns
- **Web-Based Access**: Available through [app.edublocks.org](app.edublocks.org)
- **Growing Resource Base**: Increasing collection of tutorials and project examples
- **Compatibility**: Works with both V1 and V2 micro:bit hardware
