# MakeCode (Primary Platform)

MakeCode is the official Microsoft-developed programming environment specifically designed for micro:bit. Its intuitive interface makes it the ideal starting point for most library code club participants regardless of age or coding experience.

## Key Features

- **Block-Based Interface**: Coloured blocks that snap together, eliminating syntax errors
- **JavaScript View**: Side-by-side block and text code views for seamless transition to text coding
- **Simulator**: Built-in virtual micro:bit that displays code results without downloading to physical device. Allows for quick and easy debugging
- **Offline Capabilities**: Can be downloaded and used without internet access after initial setup
- **Project Sharing**: Unique URLs for each project allowing easy sharing and remixing
  
## Technical Requirements

- **Web Access**: [makecode.microbit.org](makecode.microbit.org) accessible via any modern web browser
- **No Account Required**: Immediate coding without registration. Though setting up accounts allows participants to save projects and carry them on at home or in the next session.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Mac, Chromebooks, and tablets
- **Minimal Bandwidth**: Functional even on modest library internet connections
- **Storage Options**: Projects can be saved to browser storage, Microsoft accounts, or downloaded as files
  
## Library Implementation

- **Quick Access Setup**: Create browser bookmarks or shortcuts on all library devices
- **Project Templates**: Prepare starter projects for different skill levels and save as shareable links
- **Offline Preparation**: Download the offline version on USB drives for backup during internet outages
- **Reference Cards**: Laminated guides showing block categories and common programming patterns
- **Example Gallery**: Curated collection of project examples for inspiration

## Progression Path

- **Entry Point**: Simple 3-5 block programs that produce immediate visual feedback
- **Skill Building**: Gradual introduction to loops, conditionals, and variables through guided projects
- **Intermediate Challenges**: Creating games, interactive accessories, and data recording applications
- **Advanced Concepts**: Introduction to functions, arrays, and micro:bit radio communication
- **Text Transition**: Gradual shift to viewing and modifying JavaScript alongside blocks
