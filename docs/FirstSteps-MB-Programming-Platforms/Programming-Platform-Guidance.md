# Programming Platform Guidance

## Age-Based Recommendations

- **Ages 7-9**: Begin with MakeCode exclusively, focusing on visual programming concepts
- **Ages 10-12**: Primary use of MakeCode with introduction to EduBlocks for interested participants
- **Ages 13-15**: MakeCode transitioning to EduBlocks or Python after core concepts are mastered
- **Ages 16+**: Brief MakeCode introduction followed by rapid progression to Python

## Experience-Based Pathways

- **No Coding Experience**: MakeCode with highly structured introduction
- **Scratch Experience**: Option to begin with Scratch extension or transfer skills to MakeCode
- **Some Text Coding**: Start with MakeCode but introduce Python elements earlier
- **Significant Experience**: Quick MakeCode overview then transition to Python for depth

## Mixed-Group Strategies

- **Platform Stations**: Different areas dedicated to each programming environment
- **Progressive Sessions**: Begin sessions with MakeCode, offer Python later in the same session
- **Peer Mentoring**: Have Python users support those transitioning from blocks
- **Equivalent Challenges**: Create similar project briefs implementable in any platform

By thoughtfully implementing these programming platforms, library staff can create accessible entry points for all participants while providing clear progression paths for continued growth and engagement with micro:bit coding.
