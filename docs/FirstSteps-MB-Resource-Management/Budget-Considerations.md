# Budget Considerations

## Equipment Replacement Cycle

- Establish a 3-year replacement strategy for micro devices with annually staggered purchasing
- Calculate a projected annual replacement rate of 15-20% for heavily used devices
- Create a spreadsheet tracking device age, usage frequency, and repair history
- Develop criteria for prioritising replacements (e.g., devices used most frequently, older versions)
- Consider the benefits of maintaining both V1 and V2 micro for different activity levels
- Establish a "technology fund" within your library budget specifically for Code Club equipment

## Battery Supplies

- Budget for approximately 8-10 battery replacements per device annually for weekly sessions
- Source batteries through local council procurement contracts for better rates
- Consider high-quality rechargeable batteries with appropriate chargers for long-term cost efficiency
- Maintain a stock monitoring system to anticipate needs before shortages occur

## Additional Components

- Create a tiered purchasing plan for components based on participant progression
- Prioritise robust components suitable for repeated handling (crocodile clips, larger LEDs)
- Maintain stock of basic components (LEDs, buttons, speakers, crocodile clips) in sufficient quantities
- Budget for specialised sensors (light, temperature, motion) for advanced projects
- Consider bulk-purchasing through UK educational suppliers offering library discounts
- Establish an inventory management system with minimum stock alerts

## Project Materials

- Allocate budget for consumable craft materials (cardboard, tape, foil, pipe cleaners)
- Source cost-effective materials through educational suppliers or local businesses
- Consider establishing relationships with local craft shops for discounted supplies
- Develop a "materials contribution" system where participants bring recyclables from home
- Maintain stock of basic tools (scissors, hole punches, rulers) in sufficient quantities
- Create standardised project kits for commonly used activities to reduce preparation time

## Promotional Materials

- Budget for essential marketing collateral: posters, flyers, social media graphics
- Develop professional-looking certificates and achievement badges
- Develop digital marketing assets compliant with library brand guidelines
