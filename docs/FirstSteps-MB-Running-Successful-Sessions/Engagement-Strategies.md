# Engagement Strategies

## Creating Interactive Experiences

- **Physical Computing**: Emphasise projects that connect digital coding to physical movement or real-world applications
- **Challenge-Based Learning**: Structure activities around solving specific problems or meeting design criteria
- **Narrative Integration**: Embed coding projects within stories or scenarios that provide context
- **Personal Relevance**: Connect activities to participants' interests, hobbies, or local community
- **Choice and Agency**: Provide options within structured frameworks to allow for personal expression
- **Achievable Challenges**: Design activities with low floors (easy entry) and high ceilings (room for advancement)

## Recognition and Motivation Systems

- **Digital Badges (Available through the Code Club Paths)**: A system of achievements for mastering specific skills or completing projects
- **Project Galleries**: Display completed projects in the library with creator attribution
- **Skill Passports**: Implement physical booklets where participants track their progress
- **Peer Recognition**: Create opportunities for participants to nominate others for helpful behaviour
- **Public Showcases**: Organise periodic events where participants can demonstrate their work to family and community
- **Progress Visualisation**: Maintain charts or displays showing collective and individual advancement
- **Challenge Leaderboard**: For appropriate groups, create opt-in friendly competitions around specific challenges

## Building Community

- **Group Identity**: Develop a name and optional logo for your code club
- **Shared Language**: Create consistent terminology and references unique to your club
- **Inter-Library Connections**: Develop relationships with other library code clubs for collaborative projects
- **Expert Visitors**: Invite local technology professionals for special sessions
- **Participant Leadership**: Create roles for experienced participants to lead mini-workshops or mentor newcomers
- **Family Involvement**: Schedule occasional sessions where family members can participate alongside regular attendees

## Maintaining Engagement Between Sessions

- **Take-Home Challenges**: Provide optional activities that can be completed without a physical micro:bit
- **Online Resources**: Curate age-appropriate online tutorials and resources for continued learning
- **Project Extensions**: Suggest ways to enhance or modify in-progress projects between sessions
- **Documentation Practice**: Encourage participants to record ideas or questions that arise between meetings
- **Shared Projects**: Maintain a library of participant-created projects that others can remix or extend
- **Community Challenges**: Post problems or challenges for participants to consider before the next session
- **micro:bit Lending**: Consider a secure system for lending devices to regular participants for home use

By implementing these structured approaches and engagement strategies, library staff can create code club sessions that balance educational objectives with enjoyable, meaningful experiences for all participants, building a sustainable community of young coders who eagerly anticipate each session.
