# Essential Equipment

## Core Devices and Components

### micro:bit Devices

- **Quantity Recommendation**: Aim for 1 device per participant, but a ratio of 1:2 (one device per pair) is workable and encourages collaboration
- **Version Considerations**: The micro:bit V2 offers more features (built-in speaker, microphone, touch sensor) than V1, but both versions work for beginners
- **Bulk Purchase Options**: Educational packs typically offer better value than individual purchases
- **Management Strategy**: Number each device (e.g., with labeled stickers or permanent marker) to track usage and returns
- **Storage Solution**: Anti-static bags or small plastic containers to protect devices when not in use.

### USB Cables

- **Type Required**: Standard micro-USB cables (not USB-C) for connecting to computers
- **Length Recommendation**: 30-60 cm is sufficient for most setups; longer cables create clutter
- **Quantity**: Always have 10-20% more cables than devices to account for damage or loss
- **Management Tips**: Use coloured cable ties or tape to bundle and identify library-owned cables
- **Quality Considerations**: Invest in reinforced cables with strain relief to withstand repeated use.

### Computers/Laptops/Tablets

- **Minimum Requirements**: Any Windows, Mac, or Chromebook that can run a modern web browser
- **Browser Compatibility**: Chrome and Edge offer the best experience with MakeCode
- **App Compatibility:** iOS and Android support. Find the micro:bit app in the relevant app store
- **Public Access Options**: If using library public computers, ensure they have appropriate permissions to download files to the micro:bit
- **Alternative Option**: Consider setting up a dedicated Raspberry Pi station if library computers are limited
- **Participant Devices**: Create clear instructions for participants who bring their own laptops

### Battery Packs

- **Type**: Holders for 2 AAA batteries with JST connectors compatible with micro:bit
- **Quantity**: At least half as many as your number of devices (not all projects need battery power)
- **Battery Management**: Decide whether the library will provide batteries or participants bring their own
- **Rechargeable Option**: Consider rechargeable AAA batteries to reduce ongoing costs
- **Storage Solution**: Separate container for battery packs to prevent connector damage
  
## Supplementary Equipment

### Storage Containers

- **Device Storage**: Compartmentalised boxes with anti-static protection
- **Cable Management**: Drawstring bags or cable organisers to prevent tangling
- **Project Storage**: Clear plastic bins for storing in-progress projects between sessions
- **Labelling System**: Clear labelling of all containers for quick identification

### Name Tags and Identification

- **Participant Tags**: Reusable name badges for regular attendees (Could be 3d printed)
- **Device Tags**: Label each device with an ID number that corresponds to accessories
- **Project Labels**: Sticky labels for marking in-progress projects that need to be stored
- **Skill Level Indicators**: Optional colour-coded system to identify participant experience levels
- **Staff/Volunteer Identification**: Distinct badges for those providing assistance (Also 3d Printed Maybe in a different colour)
- **Check-out System (Optional)**: Simple inventory sheets or digital system for tracking borrowed equipment

### Display Equipment

- **Projector/Large Screen**: For demonstrations and group instruction
- **Document Camera**: Useful for showing physical manipulation of the micro:bit
- **Whiteboard/Flipchart**: For quick diagrams and notes
- **Quick Reference Posters**: Laminated cheat sheets for common commands
- **Extension Cables**: To ensure all presentation equipment can reach power sources

## Optional Equipment

### Additional Components

- **Crocodile Clips/Jumper Wires**: For extending projects beyond the device itself
- **LEDs and Basic Electronic Components**: For simple circuit projects
- **Cardboard/Craft Materials**: For building physical housings for projects
- **Servo Motors**: Simple motors that can be controlled by the micro:bit
- **Speakers**: Small external speakers for audio projects

### Resource Materials

- **Quick Start Cards**: Laminated instruction cards for common projects
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: Common issues and solutions in accessible format
- **Project Idea Books**: Physical references for inspiration
- **Progress Tracking Sheets**: For participants to record their achievements
- **Take-Home Instructions**: Printed materials for continuing projects at home

### Administrative Tools

- **Sign-in System**: Attendance tracking method (paper or digital)
- **Equipment Check-out Forms (Optional)**: Simple process for borrowing equipment
- **Photo Release Forms**: If showcasing projects on library social media
- **Feedback Forms**: Quick surveys to improve future sessions
- **First Aid Kit**: Basic supplies for minor injuries (paper cuts, etc.)

## Budget and Purchasing Considerations

### Initial Investment

- **Starter Kit Option**: Begin with 10-15 micro:bits and basic accessories
- **Approximate Cost**: Â£270-380 for a basic setup serving up to 20 participants
- **Funding Sources**: Technology grants, Friends of the Library, STEM education initiatives
- **Partner Possibilities**: Local tech companies may donate equipment or funds

### Ongoing Expenses

- **Batteries**: Major recurring cost unless using rechargeable options
- **Replacement Parts**: Budget for 10-15% annual replacement of cables and accessories
- **Expansion Materials**: New components to keep regular attendees engaged
- **Documentation**: Printing costs for handouts and reference materials

### Equipment Lifecycle

- **Durability**: micro:bits typically last 3-5 years with proper care
- **Upgrade Planning**: Budget for partial replacement every 2-3 years as newer versions emerge
- **Repair vs. Replace**: Simple troubleshooting can extend device life significantly
- **Backup Strategy**: Maintain several backup devices for immediate replacement

Thoughtful investment in quality equipment and proper management systems will create a sustainable code club program that can grow with your library's needs and participant interest.
