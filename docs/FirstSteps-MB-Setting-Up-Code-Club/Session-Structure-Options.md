# Session Structure Options

## Drop-in Sessions

### Overview

Drop-in sessions provide flexible coding opportunities that accommodate varied schedules and commitment levels. These casual sessions are ideal for libraries with fluctuating attendance and diverse participant demographics.

### Format Recommendations

- **Duration**: 2-3 hours in total, allowing participants to join at any time
- **Frequency**: Weekly or fortnightly at consistent times (e.g., Saturday mornings, after-school hours)
- **Staffing**: Minimum of one knowledgeable staff member or volunteer, with an additional helper for every 8-10 participants

### Implementation Details

- **Entry System**: Simple sign-in sheet with name, time of arrival, and optional contact information
- **Equipment Access**: Self-service station where participants collect pre-numbered devices and accessories
- **Project Selection**: Visual menu of available projects categorised by difficulty and completion time
- **Space Organisation**: Designated areas for beginners, returning participants, and collaborative work

### Supporting Materials

- **Instruction Cards**: Laminated A5-sized project cards with step-by-step guidance
- **Achievement Tracking**: Passport-style booklets where participants can record completed projects
- **Quick-Start Guides**: Prominently displayed posters with basic micro:bit commands and functions
- **Resource Table**: Reference books, printed tutorials, and inspirational project examples

### Facilitator Role

- **First-Timer Support**: Brief personal welcome and orientation for newcomers
- **Roving Assistance**: Circulate continuously, offering help where needed but encouraging peer support
- **Progress Monitoring**: Light-touch check-ins with participants to gauge engagement and understanding
- **Community Building**: Facilitate introductions between participants with complementary skills or interests

### Advantages

- **Accessibility**: Accommodates busy family schedules and spontaneous participation
- **Self-Paced Learning**: Participants progress according to their own interests and abilities
- **Diverse Engagement**: Supports multi-generational participation and varied learning styles

## Structured Workshops

### Overview

Structured workshops offer focused, guided learning experiences with specific learning objectives and outcomes. These sessions follow a planned curriculum and are ideal for deeper exploration of coding concepts.

### Format Recommendations

- **Duration**: 60-90 minutes for single-session workshops; series of 4-6 sessions for progressive learning
- **Frequency**: Monthly special events or term-time weekly series
- **Group Size**: 8-12 participants per workshop for optimal engagement
- **Registration**: Pre-booking required with reminder system to ensure attendance

### Implementation Details

- **Theme-Based Content**: Design workshops around engaging themes like:
    - Seasonal events (Christmas light displays, Halloween animations)
    - Topic exploration (space, wildlife, sports)
    - Real-world applications (weather stations, fitness trackers)
- **Session Structure**: Clear beginning, middle, and end with specific timed activities
- **Skill Progression**: Explicit building of skills from session to session in series workshops
- **Take-Home Element**: Completed project or extension activity for continued engagement (optional)

### Supporting Materials

- **Participant Workbooks**: Printed guides with workshop activities and extension challenges
- **Visual Presentations**: Slideshows for group instruction points
- **Staggered Instruction Cards**: Step-by-step guides with check-in points for facilitator review
- **Certificate Templates**: Recognition of completion for workshop series

### Facilitator Role

- **Direct Instruction**: Formal teaching moments for introducing new concepts
- **Paced Guidance**: Leading all participants through the same process with check-in points
- **Troubleshooting Support**: Addressing common challenges before they occur
- **Assessment**: Gauging understanding through observation and guided questions

### Workshop Series Ideas

- **Beginner's Journey**: Four-session introduction to micro:bit fundamentals
- **Game Development**: Series focused on creating increasingly complex games
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Building and deploying data collection devices
- **Storytelling with Technology**: Combining narrative and code for interactive stories
- **Holiday Makers**: Seasonal crafts incorporating micro:bit technology

### Advantages

- **Depth of Learning**: Allows thorough exploration of concepts and techniques
- **Consistent Progress**: Ensures all participants achieve specific learning outcomes
- **Community Building**: Creates cohort effect among regular attendees
- **Promotional Value**: Easier to market specific workshop themes to target audiences
- **Outcome Measurement**: Provides clear metrics for reporting and funding applications

## Hybrid Approaches

### Alternating Schedule

- Run weekly drop-in sessions with monthly special workshops
- Use drop-ins to build interest in upcoming structured events

### Tiered Programming

- Offer beginner workshops that feed into intermediate drop-in sessions
- Create special interest groups that meet during general drop-in times

### Session Evolution

- Begin with structured workshops to build core participant skills
- Transition to drop-in format once a critical mass of capable participants is established

By thoughtfully implementing both drop-in sessions and structured workshops, libraries can create a comprehensive micro:bit program that serves diverse community needs while building sustainable digital literacy skills.
