# Space Requirements

When setting up tables and chairs for a code club in a library setting, flexible arrangements are essential for several important reasons:

## Why Flexible Arrangements Matter

### Accommodating Varying Group Sizes

Libraries often face fluctuating attendance at code clubsâ€”one week you might have 6 participants, the next week 15. Flexible seating allows you to quickly adapt to these changing numbers without disrupting the flow of the session.

### Supporting Different Learning Activities

During a typical code club session, participants might engage in:

- Individual coding work (requiring personal space)
- Pair programming (requiring shared workspace)
- Group demonstrations (requiring clustered seating)
- Presentations and showcases (requiring audience-style arrangement)

### Encouraging Collaboration

When participants can easily reposition themselves, they can spontaneously form groups based on:

- Project interests
- Skill levels
- Peer mentoring opportunities
- Troubleshooting challenges

## Recommended Arrangements

### Pod-Style Configuration

- Arrange tables in clusters of 4-6 seats
- Position pods with enough space between them for staff/volunteers to circulate
- **Benefits:** Encourages peer learning while maintaining individual workspaces

### U-Shape for Demonstrations

- Arrange tables in a U-shape facing a demonstration area
- Place the presenter/library staff at the open end
- **Benefits:** Everyone can see demonstrations while maintaining their workspace

### Flexible Modular Tables

- Use tables that can be easily reconfigured (trapezoid or puzzle-piece style)
- Begin with a workshop configuration, then separate for project work
- **Benefits:** Quickly transitions between instruction and application

## Implementation Tips

### Pre-Session Setup

- Arrive 15-20 minutes early to arrange tables based on planned activities
- Create a "home base" area where equipment is distributed
- Designate a separate space for completed projects or demonstrations

### Mid-Session Adjustments

- Teach participants how to safely move tables and chairs if regrouping
- Use visual cues (coloured tablecloths or signs) to indicate specialised areas
- Keep pathways clear for movement and accessibility

### Equipment Considerations

- Position tables near power outlets when possible
- Use power strips strategically to avoid cable hazards
- Consider laptop/tablet battery life when outlets are limited

### Accessibility Focus

- Ensure at least one table accommodates wheelchair users
- Maintain clear pathways of at least 36 inches between table groupings
- Position furniture to allow everyone to see demonstrations without straining

By thoughtfully implementing flexible seating arrangements, library staff/volunteers can create dynamic, adaptable learning environments that respond to the unique needs of code club participants while maximising engagement and collaboration.
